push constant 0
  - put a value in the 'constant' stack

1 recieve an instruction
2 translate that instruction into assembly code
3 output that code to a file

1 instruction will accept:
  - no arguments (arithmetic, return)
  - one argument (label, if-goto, goto)
  - two arguments (push, pop)

First step: implement artimetic commands as well as <push constant x> where x is a decimal

Progress:
 - implemented assembly code that I think will push constants and add
 - need to write initialize functions to create instructions
 - would like to
  - write a simple program
  - translate instructions in irb one-by-one
  - put into asm file
  - run through virtual cpu thing
  - confirm that code works
